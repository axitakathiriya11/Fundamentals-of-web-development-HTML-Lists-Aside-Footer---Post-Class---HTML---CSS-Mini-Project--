        <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural
            experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the
            most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq.
            km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests
            of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the
            rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a
            distinct geographical entity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the
            Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the
            east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel the expanse of the country, you
            are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature,
            lands, tribes, history and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the
            old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping
            malls, and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the
            quintessential traveller can get the best of both worlds. Head to the mountains,
            enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through the golden Thar, India has options galore
            for all.</p>
